# ReactGrind Projects

This repository contains my practice projects for learning React. Each project focuses on different concepts to build a strong foundation in React development.

## 1. reactVite

In this project, I learned how to set up a barebone React app using Vite and explored the basics of state management with `useState`. This project is a simple yet effective starting point for understanding React.

## 2. reactViteTailwind

This project integrates Tailwind CSS with React. I learned how to style components using utility-first CSS classes and explored how to use React components and props effectively.

## 3. bgColorChanger

This basic project focuses on React DOM manipulation. It allowed me to understand how React interacts with the DOM to dynamically update elements, providing a solid introduction to interactivity in React apps.

Each project builds on the previous ones to deepen my understanding of React concepts. Feel free to explore the code and run the projects yourself to see them in action!
