# ReactGrind Projects

This repository contains my practice projects for learning React. Each project focuses on different concepts to build a strong foundation in React development.

## 1. reactVite

In this project, I learned how to set up a barebone React app using Vite and explored the basics of state management with `useState`. This project is a simple yet effective starting point for understanding React.

## 2. reactViteTailwind

This project integrates Tailwind CSS with React. I learned how to style components using utility-first CSS classes and explored how to use React components and props effectively.

## 4. Password Generator

In this project, I learned about `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useRef` to create a dynamic password generator. This project helped me understand how to manage side effects, optimize callback functions, and use references in React effectively.

Each project builds on the previous ones to deepen my understanding of React concepts. Feel free to explore the code and run the projects yourself to see them in action!
